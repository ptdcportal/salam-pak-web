          While winter brings frigid temperatures and snowy obstacles in the north and far-west of Pakistan, it also
          brings with it all sorts of snow-related activities. A few areas that are closed off due to snow are more than
          made up for by how pleasant the coastal cities become — where many would argue is the heart of Pakistan, and
          not to mention its beaches! Since the colder months are part of the off-season, it’s a great time to travel
          without running into crowds and on a budget, all while still enjoying the incredible sight and sounds of
          Pakistan and its many cultural events.

          With the snow, the mountain peaks are painted a royal white, and the skies are usually clear when snow isn’t
          falling, making beautiful sunsets still a possibility. Glaciers are also naturally formed during the cold
          months, adding more variety to the scenery with nature’s very own ice sculptures.

          region — which lies only in Pakistan and India. Seafood and many varieties of fish, while available all year
          round, also become more popular in everyday cuisine during the winter. And finally, on the street food side of
          things, a local version of chicken corn soup and chicken broth are sold as yummy snacks, as are pomegranate
          seeds with a delicious spice for flavoring.

          Moving away from the north, the rest of Pakistan does not see much snow, though many areas still call for a
          jacket. The coastline area, and Karachi in particular, while uncomfortably hot at times in the summer, are
          perfectly pleasant in the winter. So if you want the best experience of what Karachi has to offer — the
          culture, the food, the nightlife, and more — winter might just be the best time to swing by.

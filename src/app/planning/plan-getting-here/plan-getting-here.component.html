          Normally, there are direct flights to Pakistan from the coasts of Asia, Europe, and North America. Jinnah
          International Airport, located in Karachi, is Pakistan’s largest international and domestic airport. It is the
          main hub for international traffic flow in and out of Pakistan. However, be prepared to change your flights at
          some point, in order to reach your final destination in Pakistan. Pakistan International Airlines operates in
          23 international destinations in 14 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America as of June 2020.
        </p>

          Other airports with international flights can be found near the cities of Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, Multan,
          Sialkot, Faisalabad, Quetta, Rahim Yar Khan, Turbat, Gwadar and D.G. Khan. All larger cities and towns have
          airports offering both international and domestic flights.

        <p>
          You can reach Pakistan via bus from Pakistan’s neighboring countries, China, Afghanistan and Iran, upon
          availability of travel visas from these countries to Pakistan. Bus routes from India to Pakistan are
          temporarily suspended. Currently, China and Pakistan are connected only by the Karakoram Highway via a single
          crossing in the Khunjerab Pass. Whereas Afghanistan is connected to Pakistan via the Khyber Pass which
          connects Kabul to Peshawar. You can use a bus to reach Taftan, Iran from Quetta, Pakistan.

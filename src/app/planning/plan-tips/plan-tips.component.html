        <p>
          That way you have a far better chance of securing the most affordable tickets for public transportation such
          as flights, trains and busses – and also the cheapest accommodation.

        <p>
          This is a neat way to obtain cheaper accommodation and transportation, and you won’t have to share the popular
          attractions with quite as many others. You can also save money if you travel like a local, using public
          transport.

        <p>
          Pakistan has a great variety of camping sites with space for people to enjoy the breathtaking scenery with
          their families and friends. They are also meant for people who love solitude and are looking for a few quiet,
          uninterrupted days to themselves. It is a good idea to book a slot in advance if you are travelling in the
          high season. You can set up your camping gear in the camping sites. If you prefer, you can choose to lodge at
          a hotel/ guest house near your campsite, ranging from the very basic to the highly luxurious type. You may
          find lodging at such guesthouses at a reasonable rate. However, if you wish to truly enjoy and gain the true
          experience of Pakistan’s northern areas, we would recommend you to camp out in the open space.

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading-tips">4. Travel together</h2>
        <p>
          Plan your trip to Pakistan together with your extended family or a group of good friends. That way, you can
          rent a large guesthouse, flat or house, and use this as a base. This is an economical solution that can cut
          costs significantly.

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading-tips">5. Buy food locally</h2>
        <p>
          Having the opportunity to cook for yourself, at least for certain parts of your trip, will work wonders on
          your budget. You can cook yourself a delicious picnic or dinner from local delicacies such as Chicken or Beef
          Karahi, Biryani or Halwa Puri without putting too much strain on your budget. You can even enjoy street food
          for your breakfast, lunch, or dinner from local restaurants near your camping site, which should be perfectly
          economical.

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading-tips">6. Fresh drinks</h2>
        <p>
          A proper water bottle that keeps its contents cold is a good investment, and you can also fill it with crystal
          clear, clean, fresh water directly from natural springs at various locations. You may enjoy Lassi or
          buttermilk, a delightful Punjabi drink for breakfast at local restaurants.

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading">Calling home</h2>
        <p>
          Dial “00” followed by your two or three digit country code, the area code and phone number. On most mobile
          phones, using “+” instead of “00” will also work. If you are calling on a mobile phone, buying a local
          pre-paid SIM card may be the cheapest option. Commonly used mobile networks in Pakistan are Ufone, Mobilink,
          Zong, and Telenor

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading mt-50">Currency</h2>
        <p>Pakistani currency is the Pakistani Rupee (PKR).</p>

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading mt-50">Disability</h2>
        <p>
          Pakistan airline employees are trained to assist passengers with certain disabilities and offer them a wide
          variety of special assistance. Such passengers with special needs will be provided with assistance in moving
          to and from their seats, help in preparation for meals, and assistance in use of an inflight wheelchair to and
          from the lavatory door.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading mt-50">Driving</h2>
        <p>
          Almost all the cities of Pakistan are now readily accessible by the motorways, and the internal parts of the
          cities are also connected by highways. The time taken to reach a particular destination depends on the traffic
          and weather conditions, although traffic on the motorways rarely reaches a high point and they are mostly
          clear to drivers to relax and drive smoothly. However, weather conditions such as rain and fog may sometimes
          impede the flow of traffic on motorways and highways, which may affect the destination time. However, if you
          are aware about the oncoming weather conditions and leave for your journey on a timely basis, you should be
          able to reach your destination at your planned time. You will be able to enjoy several scenic views on your
          way to your destination if you take the motorway, such as lakes, rivers and mountains. You may stop on the way
          at a rest area, which may have filling stations as well so you may refuel your car and recharge yourself with
          a meal for your remaining journey.

          The internet access and speed is usually quite good in most towns and cities in Pakistan, however several

          whichever mobile service you are using, or get a roaming data package online or through the respective mobile

          access in the rooms, however it’s best to ask the hotel before you book. Many buses and trains offer free

          Indoor smoking is prohibited in most public places in Pakistan, including hotels, restaurants, and all other
          establishments where food and beverages are served. There are several hotels which have smoking lounges
          available for guests who would like to smoke. E-cigarettes which contain nicotine are permitted, as well as

        <h2 class="heading__title green-heading">Visa requirements and passports</h2>
        <p>
          Most foreign nationals require a visit visa to travel to Pakistan, as well as a passport which is valid for at
          least 6 months from the intended date of arrival in Pakistan. The type of visa, application procedures and
          visa requirements will vary according to the traveller’s nationality, the length of the planned stay in the
          country and the purpose of the visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, there are 5 countries whose citizens can travel to Pakistan visa-free for short stays: all other
          foreign visitors must either receive an online visa for Pakistan through an electronic application (eVisa), a
          visa on arrival, or a visa from a Pakistani embassy, depending upon their nationality. You must apply for a
          Pakistani visa in your country of origin in most cases, however you are permitted to apply for a third country
          if you are legal permanent residents of that country. The majority of foreign citizens can apply for a eVisa
          for Pakistan through an electronic application, with a few nationalities as an exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          An eVisa authorization can be approved for a permitted stay of between 14 to 90 days, and as either a single
          or multiple entry permit, depending on the destination. They usually allow travel for either tourism, transit,
          or business reasons.
